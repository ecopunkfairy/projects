According to societal, social, academic, and essentially all standards, I'm not very good at anything. Although I've played with many interests over the years, I've indignantly sidestepped any form of practice. Perhaps this is due to the fixed-mindset I'm learning to shed after years of reinforcing its structure -- if I'm not immediately talented at it, then it must not be for me. Instead, I'm swept away again and again by new passions calling out for my attention. In the constant forward flow, I haven't spared a moment to settle or reflect. In this way, I haven't so far as curated any of my work, often deeming it a passing fancy. And yet, now during the global pandemic where we are forced to sit pretty, the deep waters of my once relentless flow are crashing beside me, and I am drowning in sorrow for all of my past selves whose hard effort I have neglected. For my entire life I've been wanting to share with the world, and yet at 26, this is my first attempt in exhibiting just about anything I've put together.
